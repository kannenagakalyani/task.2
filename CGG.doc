          CREATE  A  GUESSING  GAME
aim:-to explanation about create a guessing game?
explanation:-
1.The import random statement imports the random module, which allows us to generate random numbers.
2.The guessing_game() function is defined to encapsulate the logic of the game.
3.Inside the guessing_game() function:
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100) generates a random integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and assigns it to secret_number.
We print a welcome message and instructions for the player.
We initialize a variable attempts to keep track of how many guesses the player makes.
We start a while loop that continues until the player guesses the correct number.
Inside the loop, the player's guess is obtained with input() and converted to an integer using int().
We increment the attempts counter after each guess.
We compare the guess with the secret_number and provide feedback to the player whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
If the guess is correct, we print a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts taken, and break out of the loop.
4.Finally, we call the guessing_game() function to start the game.
Output (example):
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess it?
Enter your guess: 2
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 3
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 4
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 5
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 6
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 7
Congratulations! You've guessed the number 7 correctly!
It took you 6 attempts.
This is a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 10. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and finally congratulates the player upon guessing the correct number, displaying the number of attempts it took.
