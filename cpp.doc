               CAR PRICE PREDICTOR
EXPLANATION:-
      1. Data Collection:
First, you need to gather data on various car attributes and their corresponding prices. This dataset could include features such as mileage, make, model, year, condition, and any other relevant factors affecting car prices.

2. Data Preprocessing:
After collecting the data, you may need to clean it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

3. Model Training:
Next, you'll split the data into training and testing sets. Then, you'll train a linear regression model using the training data.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Assuming you have a CSV file containing car data
data = pd.read_csv('car_data.csv')

# Selecting features and target variable
X = data[['Mileage', 'Year', 'Condition']]
y = data['Price']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
4. Model Evaluation:
Once the model is trained, you'll evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).

python
Copy code
# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
5. Prediction:
You can now use the trained model to make predictions on new car data.

python
Copy code
# Example of predicting car price for a new car
new_car = pd.DataFrame({'Mileage': [50000], 'Year': [2018], 'Condition': ['Excellent']})
predicted_price = model.predict(new_car)
print("Predicted Price for the New Car:", predicted_price[0])
Sample Output:
vbnet
Copy code
Mean Squared Error: 500000
Predicted Price for the New Car: 15000
This output indicates that the model has a mean squared error of 500000 when evaluated on the testing data, and it predicts a price of $15,000 for a new car with 50,000 miles, manufactured in 2018, and in excellent condition.
